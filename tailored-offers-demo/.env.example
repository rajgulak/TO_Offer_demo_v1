# Tailored Offers Demo - Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your API keys

# LLM Provider Configuration
# ===========================
# Choose one provider - set the API key for the provider you want to use

# Option 1: OpenAI (GPT-4)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here

# Option 2: Anthropic (Claude)
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-anthropic-api-key-here

# Optional: Force a specific provider (openai, anthropic, or mock)
# TAILORED_OFFERS_LLM_PROVIDER=openai

# Demo Mode
# =========
# If no API keys are set, the demo runs in "mock" mode with simulated LLM responses
# This is useful for demos where you don't want to incur API costs

# Dynamic Reasoning (NEW!)
# ========================
# When enabled, rules-based agents use an LLM to generate natural-sounding
# explanations instead of templated text. The DECISION is still rules-based
# (fast, deterministic), but the EXPLANATION is dynamically generated.
#
# Default: true if LLM is available, false otherwise
# USE_DYNAMIC_REASONING=true

# API Configuration
# =================
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
