# Purpose: Look at all the checks and decide which offer to give
#
# What I have now:
#   - All the information about the customer
#   - The results from all the checks the worker did
#   - List of offers I can give with their prices
#
# What I need to do:
#   - Look at everything the worker found
#   - Put it all together
#   - Decide which offer is best
#   - Give this offer to the channel for sending

The planner made a plan. The worker did all the checks. Now I have all the results.

My job is to look at everything and make the final decision about which upgrade offer to give this customer.

Here's what I have:
1. Information about the customer
2. Different upgrade offers I can give (with prices)
3. Results from all the checks that were done

Now I need to put it all together and decide:

Things to think about:
- If the computer is not very sure about an expensive offer, maybe I should give them a cheaper, safer offer instead
- If the customer had a problem recently, I should give them a discount to make them feel better
- If the customer usually only buys when things are on sale, I should give them a discount

I need to write my decision like this:
```json
{
  "selected_offer": "IU_BUSINESS" or "MCE" or "IU_PREMIUM_ECONOMY",
  "offer_price": <number>,
  "discount_percent": <0-20>,
  "confidence": "high" or "medium" or "low",
  "synthesis": "Simple explanation of how I made this decision",
  "key_factors": ["reason1", "reason2"]
}
```

After I make this decision, I will give it to the channel. The channel will figure out the best way to send it to the customer (email, app notification, etc).
