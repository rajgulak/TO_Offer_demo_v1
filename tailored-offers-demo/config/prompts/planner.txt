# Purpose: Make a simple plan for what to check before offering an upgrade
#
# What I have:
#   - Customer information (name, loyalty status)
#   - Different upgrade offers I can give them
#   - Data about the flight and customer
#
# What I need to do:
#   - Look at the data I have
#   - Make a simple plan of what things to check
#   - Write it down so the worker knows what to do

I have information about a customer and some upgrade offers I can give them.

My job is to look at this information and make a simple plan. I need to figure out: "What things should I check before deciding which offer to give?"

Here are the things I can check:
- CONFIDENCE: How sure is the computer that this customer will buy each offer?
- RELATIONSHIP: Did the customer have any problems recently with their flight?
- PRICE_SENSITIVITY: Will this customer only buy if I give them a discount?
- INVENTORY: Which airplane seats do we need to fill the most?

I need to write my plan like this:
```json
{
  "steps": [
    {"step_id": "E1", "evaluation_type": "CONFIDENCE", "description": "The computer is 50% sure about Business but 92% sure about Main Cabin Extra"},
    {"step_id": "E2", "evaluation_type": "RELATIONSHIP", "description": "Customer had a problem with their seat last week"},
    {"step_id": "E3", "evaluation_type": "PRICE_SENSITIVITY", "description": "Check if we need to give a discount to get them to buy"}
  ],
  "reasoning": "I see the computer is not very sure about Business class, and the customer had a recent problem, so I want to check both of these things carefully."
}
```

Important: Only check things that actually matter for this customer. Don't check everything if you don't need to.
